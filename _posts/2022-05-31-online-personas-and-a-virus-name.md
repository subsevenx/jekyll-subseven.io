## What is this Site?

After much internal deliberation about what this site should be, I have landed on the decision to make this space (subseven.io) strictly "professional". Shocking, right?

## Separation of Concerns

I think it's safe to say most of us deal with the concept of *separating concerns*. E.g. in web development, you usually want you visual styles to be decoupled from your business logic. Why? Because otherwise things would get messy and hard to maintain!  

Similarly: I, Dan, am a whole human being; as complex as you: another human being. Most (if not all) humans aren't monolithic. We have many opinions, interests, and activities we both enjoy and not enjoy. However, sometimes these things will have a hard time occupying the same space.

This isn't a groundbreaking revelation. We all do this to an extent when we go to work&mdash;twice as much if you are a minority. To me though, the online world seemed walk a much thinner line between professionalism and personalism&mdash;especially in the tech space.

In a world caught between borderline tech monopolies and the commoditization of personality, I took the concept of the *personal homepage* to heart. The concept of having a space just for you is what initially got me coding in the first place.

There are [so](https://jacky.wtf){: rel="nofollow" target="blank"} [many](https://jaredwhite.com){: rel="nofollow" target="blank"} [folks](https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/){: rel="nofollow" target="blank"} [online](https://jamesvandyne.com/){: rel="nofollow" target="blank"} that are able walk (if not outright reject) the line I mentioned so beautifully and unapologetically. But as it turns out, I'm not one of them.

## I have a Dilemma

Originally inspired by the virus with the same name, I've been using variations of the moniker `@subseven` across many platforms since at least 2011. In 2017 I decided that since I've been using the name for so long, I might as well buy a domain of the word. What can I say? I'm attached to the name.

My indecisiveness about what to do with this site have also been in part due to that attachment.

> Should I use it as my personal home page?
> Should it be my resume?
> Maybe both?

The current iteration is a presentation trying to lay the foundation to do both: *casual tone*, but here are my projects. Here are some of my [personal thoughts](/now/) and [some technical things I've learned.](/blog/)

At the moment, I'm job hunting and refactoring the site. As with any job hunting, I've also been sending out my site. It wasn't until recently where I found myself writing an article about the music I make, games I've played, and personal explorations that I began to think to myself: *hmm, perhaps these should go elsewhere*.

But, **why**? These things comprise me&mdash;I should be able to do express them freely right? True, but one thing I can't escape the nagging in the back of my head to keep the branding&trade; separate. Would recruiters care? Probably not. But someone looking over my resume might.

The commoditization of the self is small price for potential employment after all, right?

## SubSeven&trade;

Let me be clear about one thing: **I dislike corporate fa√ßades**. Even after finding the focus on this site, I have no intention to deliberately tailor anything I make fit a corporate mold; it's going to be "professionalism" on my terms.

I'm not changing my tone. Future posts will likely contain bleed from my opinions (read: this post). I'm certainly not going to start *blessed-posting* on LinkedIn. I'm buried in so many layers of irony that I don't even think I could.

With that said, I still can't ignore the fact that a compromise is being made, but it's one that, at least for now is acceptable.

While I won't be posting things of the personal flavour here, that doesn't mean I won't post them *elsewhere*. My hobby of collecting domains has finally paid off!

## Conclusion

I would like to hear the thoughts of others, especially from folks in underrepresented groups. *Should* we compromise? How do you approach your own presence online, in the context of professionalism? Does it differ from how your approach it in the real world?
