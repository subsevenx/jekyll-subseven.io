*This is a quick post about an issue I just fixed with on my new laptop.*

## Just Like Ten Years Ago

Oh GNU/Linux, I love you. Even when things don't quite work, I enjoy the challenges. I remember trying to get my damn GPU to play nice with Ubuntu 12.04. Ten years later, things have gotten so much better. But as they say: the more things change, the more they stay the same. 

### New Laptop, Who's This?

My last laptop is a used Lenovo Y-series that I bought off a very cautious dude from craigslist back in 2015.
It was actually a titan of a laptop and it served me very well all these years. The laptop is still very usable for more tasks (and part of me wonders just how much *more* use I can squeeze out of it). But, unfortunately the model itself is almost 10 years old, has a tiny resolution, a dead GPU, and the CPU is starting to choke with heavier loads. In short, I needed an upgrade. 

So I did what anyone I just got a new laptop this week. It's a brand new HP Pavillion Gaming laptop from Microcenter. I'm really excited about it since it's the first laptop I've bought brand-new.
