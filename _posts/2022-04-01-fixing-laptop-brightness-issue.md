**TL; DR**: What fixed the brightness issue was a mix between [this](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1329928/legion-5-pro-brightness-control-doesnt-work-on-ubuntu-20-04-with-nvidia-driver){: target="_blank"} [and this](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1317748/any-issues-running-20-04-with-a-ryzen-5000-cpu){: target="_blank"} StackOverflow post. Though I mainly attribue it to setting `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash amdgpu.backlight=0"` in `/etc/default/grub` (make sure to `sudo update-grub` after changing this.) Though It doesn't hurt to upgrade your kernel, especially if you're in an earlier build of Ubuntu. You mileage may vary wildly.

## Just Like Ten Years Ago

Oh GNU/Linux, I love you. Even when things don't quite work, I enjoy the challenges. I remember trying to get my damn GPU to play nice with Ubuntu 12.04. Ten years later, things have gotten so much better. But as they say: the more things change, the more they stay the same. 

### New Laptop, Who's This?

My last laptop is a used Lenovo Y-series that I bought off a very cautious dude from craigslist back in 2015.
It was actually a titan of a laptop and it served me very well though all of these years. 

The laptop is still very usable for most tasks (and part of me wonders just how much *more* use I can squeeze out of it). But, unfortunately, the model itself is almost 10 years old, has a tiny resolution, the GPU died a while ago, and the CPU is starting to choke with heavier loads. In short, I needed an upgrade. 

I have been out of the laptop (and PC part) buying space since 2015, so I really didn't know where to start; much less what to buy. So I did what anyone would do and submerged myself in Laptop YouTube for around two weeks. 

Come to find out, laptop tech has gotten pretty good. While there's a lot of options and critiques of said options, for me, almost anything made in the last 5 years was going to be a huge upgrade. So I set myself some parameters: powerful CPU, okayish display, a GPU, and relatively affordable. 

I settled for an HP Pavillion Gaming laptop&#8212;the model from MicroCenter specifically. I've had it for less than a week but it has been a great experience. Although I think that happiness mainly stems from the fact that I can actually *see* everything on screen. The magic of 1080p. 

## The Issue

As per tradition, I will now contradict myself. Everything has worked swimingly *\*\*under Windows.* Thing is, I don't use Windows unless I'm either gaming or making music. As of lately, I haven't been doing much of either, so I spend my days in Linux. 

Installing a distro on this laptop was pretty painless. Everything just works&#8482;...except for the brightness. No matter how many times I pressed F2/F3, the brightness was stuck at 100%. At first I thought it wasn't playing nice with the NVIDIA card (in the past, most of my issues came from NVIDIA-related topics.) To my surprise, the card wasn't even being recognized by Ubuntu! Hmm...something was afoot ðŸ¤”.

## The Solution

I've never had a computer with an AMD chip. Not because I'm an Intel fanboy or because I don't like them; it's just essentialy how the purchases came out at the time.
