blurb: >-
  <p> Here is a sample of some of my web development work. At the moment, these
  are the most recent project I've gotten permission to share. Due to the
  contractual nature of some of my work, this project list may not grow :(</p>

  <p> The TL;DR on my experience is as follows&#58;</p>

  <ul> 

  <li> I enjoy working with PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby. </li>

  <li> Infrastructure and sysadmin tasks are very interesting to me. I've been managing Linux-based servers since 2014.</li>

  <li>Copy-editing and copy-writing are things I can <em>do</em> but don't particularly enjoy (unless it's my own projects.)</li>

  <li>Technical SEO is fun and I enjoy the challenge. SEO-based marketing isn't.</li>

  <li>I <em>love</em> WordPress. I enjoy tinkering and expanding it. I even enjoy site builders! (Though only the ones that have an API to extend their functionality.)</li>

  - title: Ankle N Foot

    blurb: <p>The company website has been in my care since 2018. In the time since,
      the site has undergone a series of changes.</p> <p>In 2018, The first
      iteration of the site (now based on WordPress) was built with a
      combination of WPBakery Builder, a custom theme, and Advanced Custom
      Fields. While I had no involvement with the development of that iteration,
      I did maintain it until 2020. Maintenance primarily consisted of visual
      changes and occasional PHP for adding features to the theme.</p> <p>In
      2020 the website was due for another makeover due to performance issues. I
      transitioned the website from BlueHost to a DigitalOcean server,
      implemented a CDN, and rebuilt the site using Elementor.</p> <p>A site
      builder was requested since the staff needed to be able to make changes on
      demand.</p> <p>A new version of the website is currently being planned.
      Company is still weighing its options in regards to static performance vs.
      the functionality that WordPress provides. A headless setup is being
      considered. </p>
  - title: CAUSE Chicago

    blurb: <p>This project built in collaboration with CAUSE (a student-led
      organization) and NUSA (a non-profit.) I was approached the project after
      the organizations had met with various web developers.</p> <p>The design
      and copy was wire-framed and written by the students. My partner and I
      were simply in charge of placing the infrastructure and translating the
      students' vision into a digital version they could maintain.</p> <p>Site
      theme was built with Elementor, in-house Elementor widgets, and
      functionality/editability  via Metabox custom fields.</p>
