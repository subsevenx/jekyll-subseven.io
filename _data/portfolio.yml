    blurb: <p>The company website has been in my care since 2018. In the time since,
      the site has undergone a series of changes.</p> <p>In 2018, The first
      iteration of the site (now based on WordPress) was built with a
      combination of WPBakery Builder, a custom theme, and Advanced Custom
      Fields. While I had no involvement with the development of that iteration,
      I did maintain it until 2020. Maintenance primarily consisted of visual
      changes and occasional PHP for adding features to the theme.</p> <p>In
      2020 the website was due for another makeover due to performance issues. I
      transitioned the website from BlueHost to a DigitalOcean server,
      implemented a CDN, and rebuilt the site using Elementor.</p> <p>A site
      builder was requested since the staff needed to be able to make changes on
      demand.</p> <p>A new version of the website is currently being planned.
      Company is still weighing its options in regards to static performance vs.
      the functionality that WordPress provides. A headless setup is being
      considered. </p>

    blurb: <p>This project built in collaboration with CAUSE (a student-led
      organization) and NUSA (a non-profit.) I was approached the project after
      the organizations had met with various web developers.</p> <p>The design
      and copy was wire-framed and written by the students. My partner and I
      were simply in charge of placing the infrastructure and translating the
      students' vision into a digital version they could maintain.</p> <p>Site
      theme was built with Elementor, in-house Elementor widgets, and
      functionality/editability  via Metabox custom fields.</p>
