  - heading: Hello There 
  - blurb: My name is Daniel Hernandez and I am a web developer focusing in WordPress, PHP, and static site generation. I've worked in marketing for the past few years but I am looking to make the switch back into web development.
  - blurb: This is my second line of text that will be present in the front page.

about:
  - heading: Information About This Site
  - blurb: Credit where credit is due. This site was built with the help of&#58;
  - list: 
    - li: Jekyll&#58; I am really familiar with Jekyll. I was introduced to it in 2017 and have fallen in love with it ever since. I love all static site generators but it is just so quick and easy to work with Liquid and Front Matter to do what I need. 
    - li: Bootstrap 5&#58; I am using Bootstrap (via SASS) for time's sake. Since the theme I am using was developed by me, I needed a quick way to style things. Eventually, I will transition to custom styles. I will still probably keep Bootstrap Grid around. 
    - li: Digital Ocean&#58; Website is hosted and built on a droplet I manage.
    - li: <a href="https://github.com/Mendeo/jekyll-minifier" rel="nofollow">Mendeo Jekyll Minifier</a>&#58; A liquid-based HTML/JS minifier. Only using the HTML minification (in production).
    - li: <a href="https://github.com/jonaharagon/jekyll-bootstrap-theme" rel="nofollow">Jekyll Bootstrap Theme</a>&#58; No code was used from this repo. I took a lot of inspiration regarding how their folders are structured and modeled my site structure after it.s
    - li: <a href="http://davidensinger.com/2013/11/building-a-better-sitemap-xml-with-jekyll/" rel="nofollow">Building a Better Sitemap XML by Daviden Singer</a>&#58; A great article about implementing a site map with Jekyll and Liquid.
  - heading: Structure Of The Site 
  - blurb: Until 2019, this domain had a static HTML site (not using Jekyll.) In the fall of 2019 I transitioned it to Jekyll but I wasn't happy with the results. In the last few weeks I got a familiar itch to make something, and this decided to rebuild it from scratch. 
  - blurb: This time around I took full advantage of the external data files and Liquid templating. Around 90% of the site's content is being delivered via a handful of YAML files&mdash;this page included!
  - blurb: This allows me to decouple structure from content and makes managing plages much easier. 
  - heading: Downsides
  - blurb: The content loop I'm using to deliver the content to the pages is very linear&mdash;thus, I if want to experiment with layouts, I would have to modify it on a per page basis. This isn't an issue so far since most pages on this site <em>are</em> pretty linear. Also, duplicating some of the variables I've made will lead to...unexpected results.
