  - blurb: Credit where credit is due. This site was built with the help of&#58;
  - list: 
    - li: Jekyll&#58; I am really familiar with Jekyll. I was introduced to it in 2017 and have fallen in love with it ever since. I love all static site generators but it is just so quick and easy to work with Liquid and Front Matter to do what I need. 
    - li: Bootstrap 5&#58; Customized Bootstrap with SASS. Using a handful of components.
    - li: Digital Ocean&#58; Website is hosted and built on a droplet I manage.

    - li: <a href="https://github.com/jonaharagon/jekyll-bootstrap-theme" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jekyll Bootstrap Theme</a>&#58; No code was used from this repo. I took a lot of inspiration regarding how their folders are structured and modeled my site structure after it.s

  - heading: Structure Of The Site 
  - blurb: Until 2019, this domain had a static HTML site (not using Jekyll.) In the fall of 2019 I transitioned it to Jekyll but I wasn't happy with the results. In the last few weeks I got an itch to make something, and thus, decided to rebuild it from scratch. 
  - blurb: This time around I took full advantage of the external data files and Liquid templating. Around 90% of the site's content is being delivered via a handful of YAML files&mdash;this page included!
  - blurb: This allows me to decouple structure from content and makes managing plages much easier. 
  - heading: Downsides
  - list:
    - li: The content loop I'm using to deliver the content to the pages is very linear&mdash;thus, I if want to experiment with per-page layouts, I would have to modify it on a per-page basis. This isn't an issue so far since most pages on this site <em>are</em> pretty linear but that would make this theme pretty one-dimensional.
    - li: I am using a <em>lot</em> of components. Build time isn't horrible now but I do expect performance issues if my content grows substantially.
