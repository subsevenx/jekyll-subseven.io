about:
  - heading: Information About This Site
  - blurb: Credit where credit is due. This site was built with the help of&#58;
  - list: 
    - li: Jekyll&#58; a static site generator. I used it over something like Hugo and Gatsby since it's the one I'm most familiar with. I really like Front Matter and Liquid, so I decided to make the entire theme from scratch.
    - li: Bootstrap 5&#58; I tend not to use frameworks but I wanted to crunch out this site. I used it mainly out of convenience since I want my site to Just Work™ so I can start writing. Custom theming via SASS. At some point, this site will transition to custom styles.
    - li: Digital Ocean&#58; Hosted and built on a droplet I manage.

    - li: <a href="https://github.com/jonaharagon/jekyll-bootstrap-theme">Jekyll Bootstrap Theme</a>&#58; While I didn't use the code, I did steal how they structure their folders ( namely the SASS one) and a couple other ideas.

  - heading: Structure Of The Site 
  - blurb: Since Jekyll allows me to decouple content from markup, I decided to take a modular approach for most pages this time around. As such, a lot of the structure/content on this site is being delivered via YAML files.
  - This is particularly useful for sections with repetitive content—particularly with content that use lists and links. For example&#58; the nav menu, blog posts list, resume, home page. Using the front-matter markup, the content is looped from a YAML file, via Liquid, with predefined markup and styles
