                        <p>The company website has been in my care since 2018. In the time since, the site has undergone a series of changes.</p>
                        <p>In 2018, The first iteration of the site (now based on WordPress) was built with a combination of WPBakery Builder, a custom theme, and Advanced Custom Fields. While I had no involvement with the development of that iteration, I did maintain it until 2020. Maintenance primarily consisted of visual changes and occasional PHP for adding features to the theme.</p>
                        <p>In 2020 the website was due for another makeover due to performance issues. I transitioned the website from BlueHost to a DigitalOcean server, implemented a CDN, and rebuilt the site using Elementor.</p>                    
                        <p>A site builder was requested since the staff needed to be able to make changes on demand.</p>
                        <p>A new version of the website is currently being planned. Company is still weighing its options in regards to static performance vs. the functionality that WordPress provides. A headless setup is being considered. </p>

                    <p>This project built in collaboration with CAUSE (a student-led organization) and NUSA (a non-profit.) I was approached the project after the organizations had met with various web developers.</p>
                    <p>The design and copy was wire-framed and written by the students. My partner and I were simply in charge of placing the infrastructure and translating the students' vision into a digital version they could maintain.</p>
                    <p>Site theme was built with Elementor, in-house Elementor widgets, and functionality/editability  via Metabox custom fields.</p>
