## Information About This Site

You can find the <a href="https://github.com/subsevenx/jekyll-subseven.io" target="_blank" rel="dofollow noopener">source code for this site here</a>.

This website's theme and (most of) its features were made by me. My goal was to make a Jekyll site with almost no plugins. There's nothing wrong with plugins, I just wanted to see how I'd handle the solutions.

However, no building gets built alone and I wanna thank the following people and projects that helped make my life so much easier&#58; 
    
- <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jekyll</a>&#58; A static site generator. My favourite one of them all, even if it is Ruby-based.
- <a href="https://github.com/Mendeo/jekyll-minifier" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Mendeo Jekyll Minifier</a>&#58; A liquid-based HTML/JS minifier.
- <a href="https://github.com/jonaharagon/jekyll-bootstrap-theme" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jekyll Bootstrap Theme</a>&#58; No code was used from this repo, instead I took inspiration from their folder structures and loosely modeled this site's structure around it.
- <a href="https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/privacy-policy-template" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Arthur Gareninyan's Privacy Policy Boilerplate</a>&#58; Boiler plate for the privacy policy of this site. 
- <a href="https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Allejo's Table of Contents</a>&#58; A Liquid-based TOC that I use on my posts. Extremely helpful.
- <a href="https://www.van-porten.de/blog/2021/01/netlify-auth-provider/" target="_blank" rel="dofollow noopener">Oliver van Porten's OAuth PHP Solution</a>&#58; I was in the middle of writing my own PHP implementation when I thought "hmm... I wonder if anyone has done this." I cannot stress the (additional) headaches this saved me.

## Roadmap

So this site is now live in order to pressure me to not sit on it and "wait until it's finished." The famous line I say before I shelve projects. 

So...I decided to publish it while it still is in development. There's a bunch of features/things I want to implement/test that I haven't done so. I'll use this little section to keep track of them: 

- [ ] SEO management from within the Netlify CMS
- [ ] Honeypot
- [ ] Date archives
- [ ] Better tag and category archives
- [ ] RSS feed
- [ ] Implement icons in a resource conscious way
- [ ] More accesibility testing
- [ ] Non-proprietary comment solutions
- [ ] WebP and image management
- [ ] Night mode without a framework

If you have any resources that can help me accomplish any of these, please <a href="/contact/">contact me</a>.
