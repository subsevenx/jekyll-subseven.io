Here is a sample of some of my web development work. At the moment, these are the most recent project I've gotten permission to share. Due to the contractual nature of some of my work, this project list may not grow :(
  
The TL;DR on my experience is as follows&#58;
- 💻 I enjoy working with PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby.
- 🚠 Infrastructure and sysadmin tasks are very interesting to me. I've been managing Linux-based servers since 2014.
- 🖋️ Copyediting and copywriting are things I can do but don't particularly enjoy (unless it's my own projects.)
- 👤 Technical SEO is fun and I enjoy the challenge. SEO-based marketing isn't.
- I love WordPress. I enjoy tinkering and expanding it. I even enjoy site builders! (Though only the ones that have an API to extend their functionality.)
