I finally have pushed some of the first "production ready" changes to this website! 

Officially, 90% of the content on the site is now being delivered via YAML and NetlifyCMS. The whole website took around 1 month total time to develop. The most time consuming part was writing the CMS config file. 

There's still a lot of work to be done but now I am able to focus more on content and polish. 

Next steps: getting this site to automatically build. Netlify is a great platform but I want to see if I can spin up my own automated solution.
