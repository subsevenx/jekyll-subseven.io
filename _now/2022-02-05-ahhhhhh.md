## New Web Dev Scares Me

For the past few years I've been a little out of touch with modern web developmentâ€”I've primarily stayed within the comfort of WordPress, Drupal, and Laravel.  All PHP-based (with the exception of React, which the new generation of WordPress is now leaning on) and what one might called aging tech (which I *heavily* disagree with.)

But I know times change and as of recently I've been making an active effort to update my knowledge. So far it's been great! I've been diving into web components; they're very exciting. I've also been updating my workflow: using SASS, static site generators, playing with NGIX, and even React.

However, since doing that, I have to ask...does a one-page template really need 156 dependencies? 

I don't wanna come off out of touch or write the 150th hot take about how the web has been ruined by over-engineered front-ends...but maaaaaaan. Maybe it's just my taste. 

I've always described myself as a full-stack dev but I may lose that self-certification because my taste in fronts ends seem just so...vanilla? I don't know man.

All in all, this is still a very exciting place to explore and I am looking forward to what the future brings to the web.
