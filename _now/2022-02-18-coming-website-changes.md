## Change is Cool

I'm going to start refactoring the styles on the site; divorcing Bootstrap and embracing web components (probably with Lit) + vanilla CSS. 

When I finish my article on Jekyll, I'll also probably be migrating over to BridgetownRB. I love Jekyll, but after exploring Bridgetown for a while, I just fell in ❤️ with it. Only thing I'm a little iffy about is the inclusion of Webpack. Oh well, I'll learn.

Lastly, I'll also be exploring more headless CMS options. Netlify CMS is pretty cool but after the last markup refactor for the meta tags, the tediousness of managing the config file started getting to me.
