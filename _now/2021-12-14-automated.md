## Auto-Deployment

I hadn't worked with GitHub actions in the past before but now that I have, I wonder why I hadn't done so earlier. 

This site is now being auto-deployed! Super excited.

I will have to keep an eye on my server's resources and see if this workflow is worth the CPU cycles.

Next on the list: public source code release.
