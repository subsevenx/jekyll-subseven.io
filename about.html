    <h2>Information About This Website</h2>
    <p>This site was built with with: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jekyll: a static site generator. I used it over something like Hugo and Gatsby since it's the one I'm most
            familiar with.
            I really like Front Matter and Liquid, so I decided to make the entire theme from scratch.
        </li>
        <li>Bootstrap 5: I tend not to use frameworks (I'm stubborn) but this is one that I know best when I have to
            crunch out
            a design. I used it mainly out of convenience since I want my site to Just Work™ so I can start writing.
            Custom theming via SASS.
        </li>
        <li>Digital Ocean: Hosted on a droplet I manage. Been using them since 2014.
            The sysadmin within me likes managing servers.
        </li>

            liquid-based HTML/JS minifier.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/jonaharagon/jekyll-bootstrap-theme">Jekyll Bootstrap Theme</a>:
            While I didn't use the code, I did steal their SASS structure and other ideas.

    <h2> Site Structure</h2>
    <p> Since Jekyll allows me to decouple content from markup, I decided to take a modular approach for most pages this
        time around.
        As such, a lot of the structure/content on this site is being delivered via YAML files. </p>
    <p> This is particularly useful for sections with repetitive content—particularly with content that use lists and
        links.
        For example: the nav menu, blog posts list, resume , and portfolio sections.
        Using the front-matter markup, the content is looped from a YAML file, via Liquid, with predefined markup and
        styles</p>
    <p> Exceptions to this include this page and other pages with content I deem more "static".</p>
    <p> Source code for this site will be released once I am happy with the structure. At the moment, I am experimenting
        with more complex layouts. </p>
