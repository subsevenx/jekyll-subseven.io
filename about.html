    <h2> Site Structure</h2>
    <p> Since Jekyll allows me to decouple content from markup, I decided to take a modular approach for most pages this
        time around.
        As such, a lot of the structure/content on this site is being delivered via YAML files. </p>
    <p> This is particularly useful for sections with repetitive contentâ€”particularly with content that use lists and
        links.
        For example: the nav menu, blog posts list, resume, home page.
        Using the front-matter markup, the content is looped from a YAML file, via Liquid, with predefined markup and
        styles</p>
    <p> Exceptions to this include this page and other pages with content I deem more "static" or that need special layouts.</p>
    <p> Source code for this site will be released once I am happy with the structure. At the moment, I am experimenting
        with more complex layouts. </p>
